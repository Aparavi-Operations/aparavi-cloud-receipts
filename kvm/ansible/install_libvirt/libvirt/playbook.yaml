#
# Create a volume and a network and bring up a virtual machine
# using KVM and libvirt
#
# To run this, you need the following installed on your machine:
# libvirt 
# python3-libvirt 
# lxml
# You can install all this on an Ubuntu system with 
# sudo apt-get install \
#  libvirt-daemon \
#  libvirt-clients \
#  virt-manager \
#  python3-libvirt
# pip3 install lxml
#
# Note that this creates a storage pool in the state subdirectory of the
# playbook dir, so make sure that you remove this storage pool before deleting
# the state directory to avoid dangling references
